                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a Research Librarian for Science & Engineering at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA. In my career I am looking to leverage my 
                programming and Geographic Information System (GIS) skills </p> 
                <p>In my free time I love to be outside, especially rock climbing or skiing.
                I am a cat person but I like dogs too. I'm also interested in learning foreign languages, personal finance, and spending time with my girlfriend.</p>

                        <h3>OneFigr App</h3>
                        <p>The OneFigr App analyzes and visualizes collection use metrics for the University of Virgina Library organization. This is a python web application built using the Django
                        framework. The app takes datasets hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and analyzes them in various ways using the python libraries pandas and numpy before returning the data to the front-end.
                        The user interface allows users to modify their view of the data on the fly using JQuery and displays it in real time using a Javascript charting library, HighCharts. Also
                        included are various modals for searching and seeing more information about the dataset.

                        <h3>EcoValuator Plugin</h3>
                        <p>This is a python plugin built for the Open Source GIS software, QGIS. EcoValuator was built for Key-Log Economics to be used as a quick and dirty means of analyzing land valuation
                        across North America. Using the QGIS Python API (PyQGIS), the plugin takes publicly available land use/land cover data, analyzes it, and returns a view of land value 
                        by various parameters in the user's study area. This is freely available for download in QGIS.</p>

                        <h3>Boone Real Estate</h3>
                        <p>Since 2018 I've collaborated with Boone Real Estate (in Boone, NC) to improve and manage a direct-mail marketing campaign. We began with publicly available tax parcel data. I then set up
                        a PostgreSQL database and began to clean the large dataset (~230k records) via scripting workflows in python, using the pandas and numpy libraries, and the PostgreSQL's PostGIS extension. I later
                        merged the direct marketing data into company's Salesforce instance, which I merged with previous company data and improved to maintain data integrity. I then set-up a 3rd party software, Mapsimise,
                        to view Salesforce records in a spatial manner which allows the company to easily do custom direct-mail processes.</p>

                        <h3>Is It Dry?</h3>
                        <p>Is It Dry? is my original programming passion project. As an avid rock climber, I am obsessed with monitoring environmental conditions in order to have the best experience while I'm out on the rocks.
                        This project has evolved over time into the python application it is now, built on the Flask web framework. The application allows users to check the weather conditions at around 500 climbing locations globally 
                        using real-time weather data gathered by OpenWeatherMap and Climacell APIs. </p>

                        <h3>Virginia River Monitor</h3>
                        <p>The Virginia River Monitor is another fun side project I built in order to serve my dual obsessions of rock climbing and the weather. This application monitors the river levels in and around central Virginia
                        as many of our local climbing areas are located on or near rivers, whose height determines if a location is accessible on any given day. Virginia River Monitor is built on the python Streamlit framework, a very
                        lightweight framework meant to build data applications with little overhead.</p>
