                <p>I'm currently a Research Librarian for Science & Engineering at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, VA. My background is in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and I am
                most interested in combining my programming skills with GIS applications, in particular Free and Open Source (FOSS) GIS software. I teach workshops and courses
                at UVA related to python programming and GIS topics. I also participate in developing internal UVA library web applications, built on python web framworks such as Django
                and Flask, as well as data wrangling and data science methods. On the side, I've participated in the development of a plugin for QGIS, an open source GIS mapping software.
                The plugin, called EcoValuator, is a downloadable package to QGIS. I've also collaborated with a friend, who is a real estate agent, to develop a multi-faceted project involving
                a direct mailing campaign, managing internal data in Salesforce, and developing workflows to interface with 3rd part software.
                <br></br>
                In my free time I love to be outside, especially rock climbing and skiing. I also like to learn foreign languages, travel, cook badly, and spend time with my girlfriend.</p>
