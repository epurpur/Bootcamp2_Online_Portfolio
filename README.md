# Erich Purpur Online Portfolio

This is Erich Purpur's current portfolio of programming projects he has built and/or collaborated on as of 3/6/2021.

The application is an HTML document, styled with CSS. 
It contains three sections about me.
* About Me
* Work Portfolio
* Contact Information

The site is also responsive to different screen sizes on different devices.

In the portfolio section, I actually do have some existing programming projects I can use at the moment. A few of them are a bit amateur but they'll serve for the time being. 

I also explored some more features we have not yet covered in class, especially in CSS. I added some Google web fonts and animated features like transitions, fade in/fade out, etc.
